# Analyzing Data, the DataMade Way

You've [_extracted_ and _transformed_ the data](https://github.com/datamade/data-making-guidelines).
Now it's time to _load_ (analyze) it. Here, you'll find the principles that
inform DataMade's approach to data analysis, as well as the tools and
organizational practices that make it possible.

## Principles

DataMade's approach to data analysis combines [our principles for making data](https://github.com/datamade/data-making-guidelines#basic-principles)
with the basic principles of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

Namely, data analysis should:

1. be **reproducible** with one command.
2. be conducted using **standard tools**.
3. be kept under **version control**.
4. **prioritize legibility** to other humans.
